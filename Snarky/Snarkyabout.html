              The band was formed during Micheal League's sophomore year at the University of North Texas in Denton, Texas.
              His explanation was "...because I was so bad, I didn't place into any of the school ensembles. So Snarky Puppy
              was my way of getting to play." Since then, the band as gone on to be come an international super-band made up 
              of various members known as "The Fam" which has come to include over 40 members with additional collabs with 
              artists such as Jacob Collier, Erykah Badu, Justin Timberlake and many more.  "The Fam" isn't exclusively tied 
              to the band, frequently having members come and go even between concerts, creating an atmosphere of constant 
              change and only increasing the originality of ideas and combinations for songs, best expressed in videos such as 
              the <i>We Like It Here</i> version of Lingus. The band would go on to win two Grammys (<i>Family Dinner Vol. 1</i>
               and <i>Culcha Vulcha</i>) and move to an independent publishing platform by 2019.
