              Freddie Green was Born in Charleston, South Carolina on March 31, 1911.
               He was influenced by music at a very young age, leaning the banjo in his
                early years before taking up the guitar. Sam Walker, a family friend to his
                 father, taught Green to read music and would encourage him to continue playing,
                 even getting Green his first gig with the local community group he organized.
                 After losing his parents, he began to play around in city clubs to make money and
                 would be introduced to Count Basie, whom he would play with for the next 50 years.
                 
                 Green prided himself on his ability to play rhythm guitar, and rarely performed a solo.
                 He had a unique style of play, comping, that helped emphasize the drums and was adamant
                 that the guitar should be accompanied, not standing out. "You should never hear the
                 guitar by itself. It should be part of the drums so it sounds like the drummer is playing
                  chords - like the snare is in A or the hi-hat in D minor."
