            <div class="col-xl-12"><p class="text-justify">
              Joel Ross is a Chicago-born, Brooklyn-based vibraphonist whose sound is centerd in the post-bop tradition.
              He group up on the South Side of Chicago and is one of two twin sons to Chicago Police officers. He and his 
              brother learned to play at the age of 3 and regularly played at their church, of which the father was the choir
              director for. He began to focus on the vibraphone after joining All City concert and jazz bands, which would lead
              to opportunities to play with groups at the Jazz Institute of Chicago and later enrolling at the Chicago Institute
              of the Arts (with the school's partnership with the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz). He would get pockets of 
              mentorship from greats such as Herbie Hancock and Stefon Harris, who would later encourage him to audition for his
              band, the Brubeck Institute Jazz Quintet at the University of the Pacific which would furter develop his skill and
              ability to coordinate larger groups, ultimately cuminating into the formation of his "Good Vibes" ensemble. Thus far,
              he has an album on the Billboard Top Ten (Kingmaker) which debuted his music as a band leader.
