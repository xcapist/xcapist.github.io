                  <h5>Touched By An Angel</h5>
                <p>The ong is colorful, made vibrant by Ross' solo at the beginning of the song. Its an intersesting dynamic, a vibraphone solo, that most musicians haven't played with or experienced.
                  Members of the crowd and the band are heard "Mmm"-ing at the stream of notes that seem to just come out of his conscience thoughts. This in combination with being leader give a completely
                   new perspective on how less common instruments interact with each other.

                  <h5>Billie's Bounce</h5>
                  <p>The video is from a much earlier Ross, presumably prior to the formation of the Good Vibes band. Here you can see the evolution in style to his more recent works.
                    His tempo is much faster, completely taking the lead spot in the melody, and still giving off a "Cool jazz" vibe to his composition. He also isnt seen using his 
                     "marionette" style of play, suggesting it may have come later in his education.

                  <h5>Dream - Jerry Dutton</h5>
                  <p>This version features Ross' vibraphone alongside a few more traditional jazz instruments. I included this video primarily because of how noticable the vibraphone is
                     throughout the song. Jazz instruments typically drown out less than bold notes simply because of their build, but the vibraphone is clear above the rest, with the 
                     mid-section of the first song being an exception.

                  <h5>Touched By An Angel, Chicago 2020</h5>
                  <p>This version features just two artist, Ross and Gabrielle Garo. What's unique to this particular version is the choice in block type and the role he plays through the song.
                     Although he leads the melody and solos prior to the actual song, his purpose was as percussive background instead of his usual spotlight. Recognizing this, his taps are much lighter,
                     so as to not drown out the delicate tone from the flute.

                  <h5>Yana</h5>
                  <p>I picked this song for two reasons. The video is super weird and eclectic, but feels like a story we are already familiar with in a way (Boy meets Girl). 
                    Using colors and contrasts, he blends his fashion in with the mood of his vibraphone and meld the two together really well. The second reason was to show 
                    his "Marionette" style, which he mimics for the video.
