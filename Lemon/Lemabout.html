          <div class="col-xl-12"><p class="text-justify">Lemon Henry "Blind Lemon" Jefferson was a blues and gospel singer-songwriter and guitarist whose distinctive high-pitched voice and intricate style of guitar playing cemented him as one of the most prominent artists in the early blues movement and early commercial recording. Even at an early age, Jefferson would busk on the streets in Dallas and other East Texas towns and eventually settled into the Deep Ellum section of Dallas arund 1917 as part of the growing blues movement. He would eventually bring himself and his Texas blues to Chicago around December 1925 - January 1926, where he recorded his first tracks, and would remain there until his death in 1929.</p></div>
