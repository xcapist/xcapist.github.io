                  <h5>Matchbox Blues</h5>
                  <p>I included this because it's the most famous of his songs. It has had multiple covers, such as the rockabilly version by Carl Perkins.
                    The tune itself is a blues standard but what make it unique is Jefferson's signature high pitched vocals.

                  <h5>Black Snake Moan</h5>
                  <p>This song was well received at the time of release, and is recognized as a signature composition of Jefferson's. He uses his unconventional
                     melodic style and double entendres to make the song his own. Especially important to Jefferson was the soul of a song, but allows for a few 
                    personal touches to his rendition.</p>

                  <h5>Easy Rider Blues</h5>
                  <p>Jefferson's rendition was preceeded by Ma Rainey's recording two years earlier, but his voice cuts much clearer than Rainey's in part to his high pitched vocals.
                    He approached the song exactly like the name: easy. The tune is a great example of his unique guitar style as he moves between rhythm and lead parts.</p>

                  <h5>Pneumonia Blues</h5>
                  <p>Jefferson's version of Pneumonia Blues might be the simplest interpretation of the song, but it sounds incredible with his stripped down style. Because of this choice, his vocals come through the recording clearly,
                    making every lyric understandable through the noise of a vinyl. Its a song about a sickness and rough health, but the song feels alive and its meaning intact.

                  <h5>Long Lonesome Blues</h5>
                  <p>The style expressed in this song is very different when compared to other recordings I included. He uses a faster tempo and focuses less on his play to deliver the lyrics much bolder. He also breaks into an 
                    indistinguishable section of scat and lyric midway through, which was unusual. He also chose to stay up higher on the neck of the guitar, making the overall song pronounced higher than normal to fit his vocals better.</p>
